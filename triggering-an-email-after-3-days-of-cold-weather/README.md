# Triggering An Email After 3 Days of Cold Weather
## Context
This is the full implementation for the Python marketing automation example introduced in our [Medium article](https://medium.com/zenaton/triggering-an-email-after-3-days-of-cold-weather-f7bed6f2df16 "Triggering An Email After 3 Days of Cold Weather").


## Prerequisites

- A [Zenaton](https://www.zenaton.com/) account, API id and API key 
- An [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) API key
- A [Gmail](https://www.google.com/gmail/) account

## Going further

To make this example usable in a real-world production environment, we could:

- Use (lat, long) boxes to pinpoint users in a specific area, not a city
- Plug an email service provider like [Amazon SES](https://aws.amazon.com/en/ses/), [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/)...

Feel free to submit a PR if you extended this example!
